# Excel_Students_Scores 
This project analyses student exam results across English, Mathematics, and Science to evaluate academic performance and assign achievement categories. Using Excel formulas and structured data processing, the dataset calculates averages, identifies highest scores, and classifies each student into performance tiers for clear, actionable insights.

# Executive Summary
The dataset provides a structured overview of student performance by combining raw subject scores with automated calculations that highlight overall achievement. By computing each student’s average score and highest subject score, the analysis enables quick comparison across learners and supports data‑driven decisions such as identifying top performers or students who may need additional support. An award‑classification formula further enhances the dataset by grouping students into categories—Star Performer, Solid Achiever, On the Rise, and Needs Support—based on their average score thresholds.

# Tools Used
## Microsoft Excel
 Excel was used as the primary tool for data entry, calculation, and categorisation. Key features leveraged include:
* Cell formulas for automated calculations
* Conditional logic (IF statements) for award assignment
* Tabular formatting for clean data organisation
* Built‑in functions such as AVERAGE and MAX (if used elsewhere in the workbook)
* Excel provides an accessible and efficient environment for performing lightweight analytics without requiring programming.

# Key Processes
1. Data Entry and Structuring
The dataset includes the following columns:

Student Name

English Score

Mathematics Score

Science Score

Average Score

Highest Score

Award Category

Each row represents one student.

2. Calculating the Average Score
The average score is computed using the three subject marks.
